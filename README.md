## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend)

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local values (JWT secret, DB password, RabbitMQ credentials)
```

### 2. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up postgres rabbitmq -d
```

PostgreSQL is available at `localhost:5432`. RabbitMQ management UI is at `http://localhost:15672` (credentials from `.env`).

### 3. Run database migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update \
  --project src/core/TeamFlow.Infrastructure \
  --startup-project src/apps/TeamFlow.Api
```

### 4. Run the API

```bash
dotnet run --project src/apps/TeamFlow.Api
```

API available at `http://localhost:5000`. Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`. Health check at `http://localhost:5000/health`.

### 5. Run the frontend

```bash
cd src/apps/teamflow-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Run the background services (optional for local dev)

```bash
dotnet run --project src/apps/TeamFlow.BackgroundServices
```

Background services include Quartz.NET scheduled jobs (BurndownSnapshotJob, ReleaseOverdueDetectorJob, StaleItemDetectorJob, EventPartitionCreatorJob) and MassTransit consumers.

### Full stack via Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

All services start in dependency order (postgres and rabbitmq health-checked before API and background services start).

### Production Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Production profile includes resource limits, health checks on all containers, and `restart: unless-stopped`.

## API Endpoints

Base path: `/api/v1/`

All responses use `ProblemDetails` (RFC 7807) for errors. All list endpoints are paginated with `?page=1&pageSize=20`. All endpoints require a valid JWT (Bearer token) unless noted as anonymous.

## Running Tests

```bash
# All backend tests
dotnet test

# Specific test project
dotnet test tests/TeamFlow.Domain.Tests
dotnet test tests/TeamFlow.Application.Tests
dotnet test tests/TeamFlow.Infrastructure.Tests
dotnet test tests/TeamFlow.Api.Tests
dotnet test tests/TeamFlow.BackgroundServices.Tests

# Frontend E2E tests (requires API + frontend running)
cd src/apps/teamflow-web
npx playwright test

# E2E with UI mode (for debugging)
npx playwright test --ui

# E2E for specific feature
npx playwright test e2e/sprints/
```

Integration tests (TeamFlow.Api.Tests) use Testcontainers and start a real PostgreSQL container automatically. Docker must be running.

Current test count: **513 backend** (48 domain, 298 application, 25 background services, 132 API integration, 10 infrastructure) + **63 Playwright E2E**.

**Completed phases:**

Phase 0 — Foundation: .NET 10 + Next.js solution, full database schema, Docker Compose, test infrastructure.

Phase 1 — Work Item Management: Project CRUD, work item hierarchy (Epic > Story > Task/Bug/Spike), status transitions, item linking with 6 link types and circular blocking detection, release management, backlog query, Kanban board, realtime via SignalR + RabbitMQ.

Phase 2 — Authentication & Authorization: JWT + refresh token auth, bcrypt password hashing, 3-level permission resolution (Individual/Team/Org), team management with Team Manager scope enforcement, work item history UI, Playwright test infrastructure.

Phase 3 (in progress): Sprint planning backend (11 endpoints), sprint planning frontend with drag-and-drop and burndown chart, 4 scheduled background jobs, health checks, global exception handler, performance indexes, 513 backend tests + 63 E2E tests.

**Pending in Phase 3:**
- 1 week dogfooding with real sprint cycle
- Lighthouse ≥80 on main screens
- Production zero-downtime deploy verification
