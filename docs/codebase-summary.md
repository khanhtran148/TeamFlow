The Domain layer has no outbound dependencies. The Application layer depends only on Domain. Infrastructure and Api depend on Application through interfaces — no layer references a higher layer.

## Key Patterns

### Vertical Slice Architecture

Each feature lives in its own folder under `Application/Features/{Domain}/{FeatureName}/`. A slice contains a command or query record, a handler, and optionally a validator. Slices do not import from each other at the handler level.

```
Application/Features/Sprints/CreateSprint/
  CreateSprintCommand.cs   — IRequest<Result<SprintDto>>
  CreateSprintHandler.cs   — IRequestHandler
  CreateSprintValidator.cs — AbstractValidator
```

### CQRS via MediatR

Commands mutate state and return `Result` or `Result<T>`. Queries read state and return `Result<T>`. Controllers call only `Sender.Send()` — no direct service injection.

### Result\<T\> Pattern

All handlers return `CSharpFunctionalExtensions.Result<T>`. Errors are returned as values, not thrown as exceptions. `ApiControllerBase.HandleResult<T>()` maps error prefixes (`NotFound`, `Forbidden`, `Conflict`) to the correct HTTP status codes with `ProblemDetails` bodies.

### MediatR Pipeline Behaviors

Three registered pipeline behaviors apply to every request in order:

1. `ActiveUserBehavior` — checks `user.IsActive`; short-circuits with 403 if user is deactivated (skips for anonymous endpoints)
2. `ValidationBehavior` — runs FluentValidation; short-circuits with a 400 error if invalid
3. `LoggingBehavior` — logs request type and duration using structured logging

### Event-Driven Architecture

Handlers publish domain events via `IPublisher.Publish()`. MassTransit routes events over RabbitMQ to consumers in `TeamFlow.BackgroundServices`:

- `DomainEventStoreConsumer` — persists every event to the `domain_events` partitioned table
- `SignalRBroadcastConsumer` — broadcasts to SignalR groups via `IBroadcastService`
- `SprintStartedConsumer` — handles sprint start side effects (capacity snapshot, velocity history)
- `SprintCompletedConsumer` — handles sprint completion side effects (velocity recording, snapshot finalization)

### Permission Resolution

All permission checks go through `IPermissionChecker.HasPermissionAsync()`. Resolution order: Individual → Team → Organization. Checks happen inside command handlers, never in controllers or repositories.

## What Is Implemented

### Phase 0 — Foundation (complete)

- Full PostgreSQL schema with all tables including AI-ready tables (`domain_events`, `sprint_snapshots`, `burndown_data_points`, `team_velocity_history`, `work_item_embeddings`, `ai_interactions`)
- EF Core migrations and seed data
- MassTransit + RabbitMQ configuration
- SignalR hub skeleton (`TeamFlowHub`)
- Quartz.NET setup with `BaseJob` checkpoint pattern
- API versioning, `ProblemDetails` error format, correlation ID middleware
- Test infrastructure: xUnit, Testcontainers, `IntegrationTestBase`, test data builders
- Docker Compose full-stack configuration

### Phase 1 — Work Item Management (complete)

**Projects** — create, get by ID, list with filter/search/pagination, update, archive, delete

**Work Items** — full CRUD, parent-child hierarchy (Epic → UserStory → Task/Bug/Spike), soft delete with cascade, status transitions, assign/unassign, move to new parent

**Work Item Linking** — add link (6 types: Blocks, RelatesTo, Duplicates, DependsOn, Causes, Clones), remove link, get all links grouped by type, check blockers, circular detection via graph traversal

**Work Item History** — paginated chronological feed via `GET /api/v1/workitems/{id}/history`

**Backlog** — paginated list with filters (status, priority, assignee, type, sprint, release, unscheduled, full-text search), reorder (sort order)

**Kanban** — board view grouped by status columns (ToDo, InProgress, InReview, Done), filters, blocked item detection

**Releases** — create, get, list paginated, update, delete, assign/unassign work item

**Organizations** — create, get by ID, list

### Phase 2 — Auth & Authorization (complete)

**Authentication** — register (POST `/api/v1/auth/register`), login (POST `/api/v1/auth/login`), refresh token (POST `/api/v1/auth/refresh`), change password (POST `/api/v1/auth/change-password`), logout (POST `/api/v1/auth/logout`). Login response includes `mustChangePassword` flag.

**JWT** — 30-minute access tokens (HMAC-SHA256), 64-byte cryptographically random refresh tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes, BCrypt password hashing (work factor 12)

**Teams** — create team, get by ID, list (paginated, org-scoped), update, delete, add/remove members, change member role

**Project Memberships** — add member to project (user or team), remove member, list memberships, get current user's permissions (`GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/memberships/me`)

**Permission enforcement** — `IPermissionChecker` fully wired to real `project_memberships` data; 3-level resolution (Individual → Team → Organization) active on all mutating endpoints

**Rate limiting** — `Auth` policy on register/login/refresh; `Write` policy on all mutation endpoints

### Phase 3 — Sprint Planning & Hardening (complete)

**Sprints** — create, get by ID, list (paginated, project-scoped), update, delete, start, complete, add/remove work items, update per-member capacity, get burndown chart data

**Domain Events** — `SprintStartedDomainEvent`, `SprintCompletedDomainEvent`, `SprintItemAddedDomainEvent`, `SprintItemRemovedDomainEvent` all published and consumed

**Background Jobs (Quartz.NET)**:
- `BurndownSnapshotJob` — daily snapshot of remaining/completed points per active sprint; detects "At Risk" when remaining > ideal × 1.2; broadcasts `burndown.updated` via SignalR
- `ReleaseOverdueDetectorJob` — detects releases past their release date with incomplete items; publishes `ReleaseOverdueDetectedDomainEvent`
- `StaleItemDetectorJob` — flags work items with no updates beyond a threshold; publishes `WorkItemStaleFlaggedDomainEvent`
- `EventPartitionCreatorJob` — pre-creates monthly partitions on the `domain_events` table

**MassTransit Consumers**:
- `SprintStartedConsumer` — reacts to sprint start event
- `SprintCompletedConsumer` — reacts to sprint completion event

**Integration tests** — full test suite across all six test projects (130 test files); covers Auth, Teams, Sprints, ProjectMemberships, background jobs, and all Phase 1 features

**Frontend** — Next.js 16 (App Router) with pages for: login, register, projects list, project detail (backlog, board, sprints, releases, work items), teams list, team detail

### Org Management & Admin Improvements (complete)

**Org Management** — Organization creation with slug; member invitations (email invite, accept, reject, revoke); member management (role change, remove); `GET /api/v1/organizations/{slug}` by slug with IsActive guard

**Admin Panel** — SystemAdmin bootstrap via seed (`MustChangePassword = true`); force password change flow on first login; admin-initiated password reset (`POST /admin/users/{userId}/reset-password`, sets `MustChangePassword = true`); paginated + searchable admin grids for users and organizations; user/org deactivation and activation with token revocation and pending invitation cleanup; org name + slug update; org ownership transfer

**Admin Frontend** — `/admin/users` (search, pagination, reset password dialog, status toggle with confirm dialog), `/admin/organizations` (search, pagination, edit dialog, transfer ownership dialog, status toggle with confirm dialog), `/admin/change-password` (force-change page on first login), `/deactivated` (static error page), logout button in admin layout, 403 deactivation interceptor redirects to `/deactivated`

**User Profile** — `GET /api/v1/users/me/profile` returns rich profile (name, email, avatarUrl, systemRole, createdAt, org memberships, team memberships); `PUT /api/v1/users/me/profile` updates name and avatarUrl; `GET /api/v1/users/me/activity` returns paginated activity log from `work_item_histories`. New repositories: `ITeamMemberRepository`, `IActivityLogRepository`. Frontend: `/profile` page with four tabs (Details, Security, Notifications, Activity). Profile link exposed in UserMenu.

**Assignee Tooltip** — `AssignedAt` field added to `WorkItem`; set by `AssignWorkItemHandler`, cleared by `UnassignWorkItemHandler`; included in `WorkItemDto`, `BacklogItemDto`, `KanbanItemDto`. Frontend `UserAvatar` tooltip shows "Name\nAssigned DD Mon YYYY, HH:MM am/pm".

**Startup Scripts** — `scripts/start-all.sh` (macOS) and `scripts/start-all.ps1` (Windows) start all services in parallel.

**Test count:** 1015+ (includes 14 Playwright E2E tests for User Profile in `e2e/profile/profile.spec.ts`)
